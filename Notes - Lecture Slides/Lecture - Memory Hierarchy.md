		- cache blocks, set associativity


### MEMORY WALL
---
memory speed is not catching up to CPU speed exponential growth

solutions:
	- build faster memory (hard)
	- build small fast memory
	- ==create a hierarchy of memory systems==

### CACHE
---
first check the cache; goto main memory if data is not found

## INCLUSIVENESS
lower memories are ==*subsets*== of higher memories


# LOCALITY
---
### TEMPORAL LOCALITY
accessing same memory location frequent â†’ high temporal locality
	keep most recently accessed data items closer to the processor

### SPATIAL LOCALITY
if a program accesses memory location M, it is likely it will access M + k soon
	move blocks consisting of contiguous words closer to the processor
